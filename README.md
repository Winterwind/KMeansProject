# KMeansProject
A short two-part project that uses kmeans for clustering and image compression

## Task 1
This is the clustering part; it includes [the .csv file](Task1/housing.csv) from which the data were drawn along with the map of California used for the backdrop of the clustering.

## Task 2
This the compression part; it includes the images used, both [pre-compression](Task2/beach.bmp) and [post-compression](Task2/beach_compressed_k1.bmp).
